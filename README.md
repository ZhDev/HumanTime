# Human Time

Human Time is a simple and customizable human readable watch face for Android Wear. The watch face displays the time in the way people generally tell the time. For example, a few of the sentences that could be displayed by the watch would be:

* half past eight
* three o'clock
* quarter to seven

Here's a small preview of how the watch would look like:

The companion mobile app lets the user customize the watch face. The following settings can be modified:

* Background: Color or image from the gallery
* Text color
* Text style: **bold** or _italic_
* Text shadow

The app has been uploaded to Google Play, you'll find it here, along with more screenshots of the mobile app:
